                                        for many of us, for all of Jodhpur. Yes, the place from which I belong, the city
                                        which is as blue as the sky and as sweet as its mithais, and a reason of pride

                                        its citizens, came into existence on this day by the blessed hands of Rao Jodha

                                        after my native place came into existence. It was just a coincidence or perhaps,

                                        Jodhpur has history beyond 1459 but I will enlighten that part sometime later.
                                        Jodhpur itself folds many
                                        stories of heroics, bravery, loyalty, mystic etc. Once you been there and you

                                        of this magnificent city. But, before I proceed to the story I feel that I

                                        the middle
                                        of the hot bowl and thus burnt his hands. Seeing this, the wife of the farmer
                                        scolded him and compared this act of his with that of King Rao Jodha Ji’s
                                        mistake
                                        of
                                        attacking Mandore rather than capturing outlying small forts. She was unaware of
                                        the
                                        fact that he is the King himself. This incident prompted him to reconsider his
                                        strategies and to stop worrying about Mandore and shift his focus to adjacent
                                        forts.
                                        He won the outlying forts with ease. Thus, by 1453, he was able to conquer the
                                        kingdom’s capital Mandore and soon after, he conquered adjacent territories like
                                        Sojat, Merta, Koshana, etc. This enabled him to establish the Jodhpur State
                                        which
                                        then came to be known as Marwar.

                                        In 1459 he shifted his capital from Mandore to a more secure place at the
                                        hilltop
                                        of
                                        “Panchetia Hill”, however, he had wished to built it on “Masuria Hill” but
                                        shortage
                                        of Water forced him to shift it to “Panchetia Hill”. Like I said Jodhpur is full

                                        stories as there is another story behind the above mentioned incident but let's
